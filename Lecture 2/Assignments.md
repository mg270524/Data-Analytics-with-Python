Q3. Write a python programme (UDF) to input three real numbers a,b and c 
and check if it forms a triange. If so find the nature of the triangle 
and hence print its area using the Heron's formula.

Q4. Write a python programme (UDF) to find the root of an equation f(x) = 0 
using the bisection method and hence use your defined function to find the 
root of a cubic ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 in an appropriate domain.

Q5. Write a python programme to find the approximate value of pi 
using the Monte Carlo method.

Q6. Write a python programme to estimate the value of log(a) for any 
positive real numbers a using the Mclautrin series expansion.
